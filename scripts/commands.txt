# Test queue: mix of successful and failing PowerShell commands
# Run these to exercise `scripts/command-runner.ps1` behavior. After testing, archive or clear this file.

# --- Successful step (should always run)
Write-Output "TEST: step 1 - ok"

# --- Forced failing command: a terminating error (will stop the runner unless -ContinueOnError is used)
throw "FORCED FAILURE 1"

# --- This should not run when the runner is invoked without -ContinueOnError
Write-Output "TEST: step 3 - should NOT run when not using -ContinueOnError"

# --- Commands to validate ContinueOnError behavior
Write-Output "CONTINUE-TEST: step 1 - ok"
throw "FORCED FAILURE 2"
Write-Output "CONTINUE-TEST: step 3 - should run despite previous failure"

# End of test queue
