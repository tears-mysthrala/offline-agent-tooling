Please operate through the workspace wrapper workflow:
- Queue every command in scripts/commands.txt with one command per line and surrounding comment lines that explain why the command is needed.
- Keep queued commands idempotent; call out any destructive steps before running them.
- Once the queue is ready, run pwsh -File scripts/command-runner.ps1 (add -ContinueOnError when later commands must still run).
- Read the latest logs/command-runner-<timestamp>.log to validate results and capture the exact lines you need.
- Reconcile results with the plan and clear or archive scripts/commands.txt after successful execution so the queue does not repeat.
